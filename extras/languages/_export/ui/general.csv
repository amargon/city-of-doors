Reference to a spell from the tabletop Warcraft RPG:
«Because of the ambient arcane energies unleashed during the breaking of the world long ago, Azeroth is never silent for anyone who practices arcane magic, for the incantations of every spell ever cast remain as echoes on the wind. These voices, discernable by any arcane spellcaster who strains to hear them, are the nether whisper.»"
