"♀20","One of the more popular temples to a good power, favored by travelers and explorers. Supposedly houses a portal to Mount Olympus on Arborea.","","Temple of Hermes"
"♀22b","A tavern and inn that appeals to the high rollers of Sigil. Finest food and drink, accompanied by a few rooms where plenty of gambling takes place, including the eponymous Wheel.

"C54", "It’s a junkyard, where the dabus gather the refuse collected from the city’s streets into horrible, stinking piles.

"H6","Aoskar is&nbsp;perhaps the&nbsp;most infamous deity in&nbsp;Sigil; once coming close to&nbsp;calling that city home, now he&nbsp;is&nbsp;forgotten by&nbsp;nearly all, and those that do&nbsp;still know his&nbsp;name almost always know him only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cautionary tale, a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fate that would befall all deities that would seek to&nbsp;unseat the&nbsp;Lady.

"H24","The best known and best funded of a handful of charity kitchens in the Hive, run by Allesha Sheevis. Nobody is turned away, and the food is free. The place also puts up those who are willing to donate a little work each day, or drop a coin in the donation box.","","Allesha’s Pantry"
"H25","Mounts to rent or purchase, though their quality is rather dubious.","","Green Stone Stables"

"H39","A scar on the already hideous Hive, a neighborhood that was destroyed in a sudden intrusion of the Blood War into the city centuries if not millennia ago. Something taints the place ever since, making any attempt at rebuilding futile.","","The Slags"

"L15","A local favorite thanks to its numerous “dancers” who provide the atmosphere.","","Mermaid’s Cups Festhall"

"L25","A cramped, overstuffed bookstore where one can find almost any title as has been written.","","Parted Veil Bookshop"
"L27","A shop that specializes in anything with moving parts, and itself is a constantly shifting mechanical sculpture.

Managed by Saddam Hasan ibn Arvalas, originally from Toril.","","Hands of Time Clockwork Shop/Guildhall"

"L57","Monstrous church, once the headquarters of the Zactars. Most locals beleive that the cathedral is cursed.","","Zactar Cathedral"
"U1","<p>No powers are revered there, far below the Hive Ward: the name simply conveys its aura of&nbsp;fear and evil. A yagnoloth named Incarus serves as the “high priest” of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Temple. His servants include two nycaloth lieutenants (Vaniure and Ghargaross) and a large force of mezzoloth, piscoloth and canoloth underlings.</p><p>The Nightmare Shaft at the center of the temple allows the yugoloth to seep into the dreams of others.</p>","","Temple of Darkness"
"A1","Rolling roadhouse, teetering on the edge of Sigil.","","Funicular"
"A2","From the outside it seems nothing more than a door on some nondescript wall. Actually it’s a portal to a demiplane. Brimarc, a githzerai who runs the&nbsp;place, enjoys picking up the magical door and moving it from time to&nbsp;time, to keep it really secret.","","Secret Door Safe House"
"A3","<p>The World Serpent Inn is both a place and a nonplace, existing in multiple planes simultaneously and nowhere at all.</p><p>The Inn’s main entrance is a two-way portal, though its destination changes frequently. Usually it takes on an appearance appropriate for its surroundings, such as a never-beforenoticed storefront in town, a roadside tavern conveniently placed to provide shelter from a storm, or a cavern revealed by a rockslide.</p><p>The portal, regardless of its appearance, is always marked with the symbol of a serpent curled into a horizontal figure eight (the sign of infinity), eating its own tail.</p>","","World Serpent Inn"
"O2","<p>Communals beleived that everything belongs to everyone, including the&nbsp;Lady’s share of the power.</p><p>One day, everyone in the Communal headquarters (the&nbsp;City Provisioner’s) vanished. The best guess is they were all trapped into one Maze in the&nbsp;Ethereal Plane.</p>","","City Provisoner"
